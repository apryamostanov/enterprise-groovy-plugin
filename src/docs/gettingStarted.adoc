== Getting Started

1.  To get started install the Enterprise Groovy plugin, in your `build.grade`:
[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {1"
        classpath 'com.virtualdogbert:enterprise-groovy-plugin:1.0'
    }
}

apply plugin: "enterprise.groovy.plugin"
----
2. Run some of the setup Gradle tasks `setupEnterpriseGroovyConventions` or `setupEnterpriseGroovyGrailsConventions`. This will provide
you with a `conventions.groovy` file in the root of your project, that you can use to configure the
Enterprise Groovy Plugin.


=== Example applications

Here is an example app with commented out code that will cause the build to fail, because of the static
compilation, or rules set in the conventions.groovy:
