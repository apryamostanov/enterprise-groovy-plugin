== Custom Compiler Script

The Enterprise Groovy plugin also supports setting a custom compiler script, by setting the following property in gradle.properties:
[source,groovy]
----
compilationScript = compilerConfig.groovy
----

This is just a file path relative to the root of the project.

For more information on what you can do with a custom compiler script checkout this mrhaki blog:

While a custom compiler script can provide functionality similar to this plugin, for compile static, it's not at flexible, and your
mileage may vary.
